# `go work`spaces

**One of the other `1.18` features**, not generics.

What is the go workspace feature?
- It's part of the go module system for specifying dependencies.
- Helps you quickly modify a package you are interested in adding to or fixing up.
  - Start with a workspace any time you say to yourself "Oh! this would be so cool if I could do X"!
    and want an easy way to try out your idea.
- Serves as a quick way to tell a test app you want to use your local version of a package.
  - You can do so without littering your `go.mod` file with replace directives.

---


- Adds a new commands to the Go tool chain `go work`
  - `go work init`
    - create a new empty `go.work` file
  - `go work use <path-to-some-local-package>`
    - specify a local package you want your test app to use
    - the a

- A workspace is a collection of modules on disk that are read/write.

# Why were they added?

- Why were they added?
  - Sometimes working with multiple modules can be clumsy.
  - The same behavior with a go.mod file would require replace statements.
    - The replace statements would need to be removed prior to the next version
    release of the module.
    - You may accidentally commit the replace statements and cause a build failure

---

#  When to use it.
- How to use it?
  - A workspace can be declared in a `go.work` file.
    - The simplest way to generate a one of these is `go work init`
    - You end up with nearly an empty file
    - `go work use <path to a dir w/ a go.mod>` The argument to the use directive is a directory with
    another module's go.mod file.

# How can we use it?
  - Local GoBrake development
    - Imagine you are working on a new GoBrake feature.
    You want to test this feature on a local app let's say a gin app.
  - unpublished modules/forks/clones
    - You've spotted a go package that looks like fun and you want to get hands
    on learning more about it. Maybe you've had an idea and want to give it a shot.
    Workspaces make this pretty easy. You get a simple driver app run:
    ```go
    go work init
    go work use <path to pkg>
    ```
    and specify the path to the package you want to work on with `go work use <path to package>`

---

# Where is it?

  - go workspaces are a valuable tool to setup local development feedback
  loops. Where you want to explore an idea and see your changes quickly.
  - After you are done getting things working the way you like, you can easily
  remove the go.work file when you want your test app to use the go.mod version
  of the package.
  - Also worth noting if you ever want to disable workspaces for a single run
  you can do so by prefixing your go command with `GOWORK=off`. .e.g.
  ```go
  GOWORK=off go run main.go
  ```
